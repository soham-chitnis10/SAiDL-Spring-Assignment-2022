# Literature Review
1. ConvNeXt was trained on CIFAR-10 dataset Notebook can found [here](https://github.com/soham-chitnis10/SAiDL-Spring-Assignment-2022/blob/main/Literature%20Review/ConvNeXt_Cifar10.ipynb)
2. The activation function was changed from GELU to ReLU and additionally learning rate decay was used for training Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/soham-chitnis10/SAiDL-Spring-Assignment-2022/blob/main/Literature%20Review/ConvNeXt_Cifar10_ReLU.ipynb)
